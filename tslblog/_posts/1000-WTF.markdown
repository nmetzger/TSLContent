Yes...the site looks a little different this morning. Let me explain.

Yesterday, we were hacked for the umpteenth time. Our Wordpress install
was compromised. I had a long day at work, and when I saw the glory of
my Lair being used by hackers, I decided that enough was enough. Death
to Wordpress. 

I shut down the site, backed up the files and the database, and removed
the Wordpress install. After discussion with my staff, we've decided to
rebuild the site from scratch. Hence the strange look and feel this
morning. 

Pardon our dust while we remodel. You'll see changes rolling out over
time. I'm working to restore the old content, and new content will roll
out as is possible. We thank you for sticking with us while we make the
site better than it was before. 

Better. Stronger. Faster.
